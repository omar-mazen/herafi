##  Project Overview

**Hirafi** is a full-stack web application that bridges the gap between clients and skilled craftsmen. In today‚Äôs digital world, finding reliable household services can be time-consuming and frustrating. This platform streamlines the process by offering a robust interface for both sides to connect, collaborate, and manage tasks efficiently.

Craftsmen can showcase their portfolio, receive job offers, and maintain their reputation, while clients can easily find, review, and hire craftsmen based on skills, location, and ratings.
